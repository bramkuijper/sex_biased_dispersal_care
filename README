Sex-biased dispersal and the evolution of sex-differences in care

Individual-based simulations

This source code is used in the paper:
Kuijper, B. & Johnstone RA. (2015) 
How sex-biased dispersal affects conflict over parental investment
http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/026732  

What is needed to run this code:
1. a c++ compiler
2. an installation of the gnu scientific library (gsl)
https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

Installing gsl in Linux is easy, see the package
manager for your distribution

Similarly easy in Mac OS X: install homebrew: http://brew.sh 
and then type 'brew install gsl'

Under Windows installing GSL might be a bit more difficult.
However, with Mingw (http://www.mingw.org) it should be possible.
see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30015656/using-gnu-scientific-library-gsl-under-windows-x64-with-mingw 

In addition, a python script plot_sims.py is added to plot output, which 
relies on libraries like matplotlib, pandas. These should be
straightforward to install.

Any questions re the simulations or the analytical model, let me know
